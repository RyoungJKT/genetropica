## Data Schema

### Core Data Tables

#### 1. Features Table (`features.csv`)
Primary dataset combining all variables by province and month.

| Column | Type | Description | Range/Values |
|--------|------|-------------|--------------|
| date | datetime | First day of month | 2017-01-01 to present |
| province_id | string | Province code | DKI, JABAR, JATENG, JATIM, BANTEN, DIY |
| cases | integer | Monthly dengue cases | 10-2000 |
| rainfall_mm | float | Average monthly rainfall | 10-400 mm |
| temperature_c | float | Average temperature | 26-30°C |
| dominant_serotype | string | Most prevalent serotype | DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, DENV4 |
| denv1_share | float | Proportion of DENV1 | 0.0-1.0 |
| denv2_share | float | Proportion of DENV2 | 0.0-1.0 |
| denv3_share | float | Proportion of DENV3 | 0.0-1.0 |
| denv4_share | float | Proportion of DENV4 | 0.0-1.0 |

**Constraints:**
- Sum of denv[1-4]_share = 1.0 for each row
- All values non-null after preprocessing
- Monthly frequency (MS) datetime index

#### 2. Geographic Data (`provinces.geojson`)
Spatial boundaries and metadata for provinces.

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "province_id": "DKI",
        "province_name": "DKI Jakarta",
        "lon": 106.8456,
        "lat": -6.2088
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [[[...]]]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Feature Engineering

### Temporal Features

1. **Seasonal Decomposition**
   ```python
   seasonal_pattern[month] = mean(cases[month] for all years)
   deseasonalized = cases - seasonal_pattern[month]
   ```

2. **Lagged Climate Variables**
   ```python
   rainfall_lag1 = rainfall.shift(1)  # 1-month lag
   rainfall_lag2 = rainfall.shift(2)  # 2-month lag
   ```

3. **Rolling Statistics**
   ```python
   cases_ma7 = cases.rolling(window=7).mean()
   rainfall_std = rainfall.rolling(window=30).std()
   ```

### Spatial Aggregation

When multiple provinces selected:
```python
aggregate_cases = sum(cases by month)
aggregate_climate = weighted_mean(climate by province population)
```

### Serotype Metrics

1. **Dominant Serotype**
   ```python
   dominant = argmax([denv1_share, denv2_share, denv3_share, denv4_share])
   ```

2. **Diversity Index** (Shannon Entropy)
   ```python
   H = -sum(p * log(p) for p in [denv1_share, ..., denv4_share] if p > 0)
   ```

## Forecast Mathematics

### Model Specification

**Seasonal Naive + Climate Regression**

The forecast model combines seasonal patterns with climate effects:

```
y_t = S_t + β₀ + β₁·R_{t-lag} + ε_t

where:
  y_t = dengue cases at time t
  S_t = seasonal component for month(t)
  β₀ = intercept
  β₁ = rainfall coefficient  
  R_{t-lag} = rainfall at time (t-lag)
  ε_t = error term ~ N(0, σ²)
```

### Parameter Estimation

1. **Seasonal Component**
   ```python
   S[month] = mean(cases[month] across all years)
   ```

2. **Regression Coefficients** (via OLS)
   ```python
   X = [1, rainfall_lag]
   y = cases - seasonal
   β = (X'X)⁻¹X'y
   ```

3. **Prediction Intervals** (95% confidence)
   ```python
   forecast ± 1.96 * σ_residual
   ```

### Model Validation

**Rolling One-Step-Ahead Backtest**

```python
for t in test_periods:
    train = data[:t]
    fit_model(train)
    predict[t+1] = forecast(1_month)
    actual[t+1] = data[t+1]
    
MAE = mean(|actual - predict|)
RMSE = sqrt(mean((actual - predict)²))
```

### Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Acceptable | Good | Excellent |
|--------|------------|------|-----------|
| MAE | < 200 cases | < 150 cases | < 100 cases |
| RMSE | < 250 cases | < 180 cases | < 120 cases |
| MAPE | < 30% | < 20% | < 15% |

## Ethical Disclaimers

### Clinical Use Warning

⚠️ **This model is NOT validated for clinical decision-making**

- Predictions are statistical estimates, not medical recommendations
- Always consult qualified epidemiologists for outbreak response
- Model assumes data quality and completeness that may not reflect reality

### Data Privacy

✅ **No patient-level data is used or stored**

- All data is pre-aggregated by province and month
- No personally identifiable information (PII)
- Complies with health data privacy regulations

### Model Limitations

1. **Assumes stationarity** - Climate change impacts not modeled
2. **Limited to 6 provinces** - Not validated for other regions
3. **Mock data currently** - Real-world performance will differ
4. **No vector dynamics** - Mosquito population not directly modeled
5. **No intervention effects** - Doesn't account for control measures

### Responsible Deployment

Before using for public health planning:
- Validate with local historical data (minimum 3 years)
- Compare with existing surveillance systems
- Establish performance baselines
- Regular model retraining (quarterly recommended)

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How accurate are the forecasts?**
A: Current MAE ~150 cases/month on mock data. Real-world validation ongoing.

**Q: Can this predict outbreaks?**
A: It identifies seasonal trends and climate risks, not specific outbreak events.

**Q: What about other arboviruses?**
A: Architecture supports Zika/Chikungunya - pending data availability.

**Q: How often is data updated?**
A: Currently static mock data. Production target: weekly updates.
